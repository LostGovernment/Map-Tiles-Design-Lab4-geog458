# Basemap Design and Tiles Generation  

## Lab Project 4 SPR 2022




Map Design is one of the topic in digital geography; understanding tiles, and designing basemap are all important part of map making. This project then exposes students to the concept of "map tiles", and how to generate them from web-based mapping platform like MapBox, and propriety GUI of QGIS. To make it clear, here is the definition of map tiles:

    "A tile map is a map in which each region is represented by a single 
    tile of the same shape and size. 
    For example, a square tile map of the United States would consist
    of square tiles of the same size for each state, regardless
    of the geographic area of each state".

    


For this lab assignment, I have decided to create four distinct maps which I developed on MapBox Studio. 


1. The first one is a basemap that. 



2. The Broadband Speed Test is the theme of the map below. It is limited to only washington state. The cyan color dots represent each broadband that has been tested, and it shows different area especially in between western and eastern Washington. 



3. The third map 



4. The fourth map
